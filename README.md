# Analysis of Hard-to-predict (h2p) branches
## Author: Prajyot Gupta
Developing a framework to identify hard-to-predict (H2P) branches using trace-based ChampSim simulator for SPEC17 benchmarks. The final goal is to develop a tightly-coupled accelerator which would offload the execution of the predicated on a heterogenous reconfigurable fabric to provide gains in regions of code with h2p branches.

## Implementing H2P predictor referring Tarsa et al.
